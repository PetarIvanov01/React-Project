# Blog for Goals

## Project Overview
Blog for Goals is a web application designed to allow users to share their personal goals with others. This project serves as a learning experience, focusing on best practices and delivering a good user experience (UX) and user interface (UI).

## Project Scope

### Features
- **Authentication:** Users can register and log in, with the ability to customize their profiles (Username, Avatar image, Category, and About Me) during registration.
- **Search:** Everyone can search for users by their names or categories.
- **Home View:** Non-registered users are greeted with two of the most followed people.
- **Catalog View:** Users can view all profiles and search by name or category.
- **Profile Details:** Users can access detailed information about a profile by clicking "Show Details" on the catalog page. Information includes Username, Followers, About Me, and the user's created goals. Registered users can now follow other user profiles and interact with their posts (like, comment).
- **Goals (Registered Users):** Registered users can create, edit, and delete their goals. Each user can have up to two goals.
- **Pagination:** The catalog view now supports pagination, allowing users to navigate through a large number of profiles easily.
